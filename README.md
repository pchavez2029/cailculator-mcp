**Applied Pathological Mathematics™** was born from this hypothesis:

*Higher-dimensional algebras following the Cayley-Dickson sequence, which have been wrongly dismissed as "pathological" mathematics, can be interpreted and exploited for computational advantage, with particular benefits for AGI research and development.*

# CAILculator MCP Server

**High-dimensional mathematical structure analysis for AI agents**

*"Better math, less suffering"*

## What This Is

A Model Context Protocol server that lets AI agents compute with Cayley-Dickson algebras (sedenions 16D, pathions 32D, up to 256D) and associated Clifford algebras. Built on verified mathematical research into zero divisor patterns and structural properties discovered through systematic computational enumeration. Formally verified with Lean 4 proofs via Harmonic Math's Aristotle.

## Why "Pathological" Might Mean "Powerful"

Beyond quaternions (4D) and octonions (8D), the Cayley-Dickson construction produces algebras with properties that violate conventional mathematical expectations:

- **Non-associativity**: (a × b) × c ≠ a × (b × c)
- **Zero divisors**: Non-zero numbers P, Q where P × Q = 0
- **Loss of division algebra structure**: Not every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse
- **Dimensional complexity scaling**: Pattern counts grow superlinearly

These properties are called "pathological" because they break the rules of "nice" algebra that works for reals, complex numbers, quaternions, and octonions.

**Pathological, however, doesn't mean useless.**

Zero divisors exhibit patterns and symmetries. Non-associativity encodes order-dependence and context-sensitivity. The vast space of algebraic dark matter in higher-dimensional math becomes huntable through hypothesis-driven computational enumeration: structure over brute force, verification over assumption.

This server based on Applied Pathological Mathematics™ was designed to offer advantages for:
- High-dimensional representation learning
- Pattern detection in complex systems
- Algebraic approaches to neural architecture
- Structure-preserving embeddings
- Time series regime detection

## Mathematical Foundation

### Cayley-Dickson Construction

The Cayley-Dickson construction recursively doubles dimension:
- **R** (reals, 1D) → **C** (complex, 2D) → **H** (quaternions, 4D) → **O** (octonions, 8D)
- **S** (sedenions, 16D) → **P** (pathions, 32D) → 64D → 128D → 256D...

Each doubling loses algebraic properties:
- C: loses ordering
- H: loses commutativity
- O: loses associativity
- S and beyond: gain zero divisors, lose division algebra structure

### Zero Divisors

A **zero divisor** is a pair of non-zero elements P, Q in an algebra where P × Q = 0.

In our research, we focus on two-term zero divisors of the form:
```
(e_a ± e_b) × (e_c ± e_d) = 0
```

where e_i are basis elements and a, b, c, d are distinct indices.

**Verified Pattern Counts:**
- 16D (Sedenions): 84 base patterns, 168 ordered patterns
- 32D (Pathions): 460 base patterns, 920 ordered patterns

These patterns exhibit:
- **Block structure**: 16D blocks replicate with cross-block mixing
- **Conjugation symmetry**: Predictable sign-flip behavior
- **Computational stability**: Numerical verification to machine precision (< 1e-13)

### Research Foundation

Built on systematic computational enumeration published at DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.17402496](https://zenodo.org/records/17402496) - Framework-Independent Zero Divisor Patterns in Higher-Dimensional Cayley-Dickson Algebras: Discovery and Verification of The Canonical Six. Partial formal verification in Lean 4 (822 lines, 83% coverage) provides machine-verified mathematical proofs of core structural claims.

Recent work has identified connections to E8 exceptional Lie algebra structure (October 2025 discoveries) with modular development integrated. Ongoing research will continue further development into 512D.

## Troubleshooting

### Windows Issues

**"pip is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet"**

Use the Python launcher instead:
```powershell
py -3.13 -m pip install cailculator_mcp
```

**"Cannot install on Python version 3.14"**

Python 3.14 is not yet supported due to the numba dependency. Install Python 3.13 instead:
1. Uninstall Python 3.14
2. Download Python 3.13 (64-bit) from https://www.python.org/downloads/
3. Reinstall CAILculator

**"Failed to build 'scipy' when getting requirements"**

You likely installed 32-bit Python. CAILculator requires 64-bit Python:
1. Uninstall current Python
2. Download "Windows installer (64-bit)" from https://www.python.org/downloads/
3. Reinstall and verify with: `py -3.13 -c "import platform; print(platform.architecture())"`

Should show: `('64bit', 'WindowsPE')`

**PATH Warnings During Installation**

Warnings like `WARNING: The script cailculator-mcp.exe is installed in '...' which is not on PATH` are safe to ignore. You can still run CAILculator by using the full path in your Claude Desktop configuration.

**"API key validation failed"**
- Verify your API key is correct in `claude_desktop_config.json`
- Ensure `CAILCULATOR_ENABLE_OFFLINE_FALLBACK` is set to `"true"`
- Check that you used double backslashes (`\\`) in Windows paths
- Restart Claude Desktop completely (quit and reopen, not just refresh)
- If issues persist, contact support: paul@chavezailabs.com

**CAILculator Not Showing in MCP Servers**
- Verify the command path in your config file is correct
- Check for syntax errors in your `claude_desktop_config.json` (use a JSON validator)
- Ensure you restarted Claude Desktop completely
- Check Claude Desktop logs for errors

### macOS/Linux Issues

**"command not found: cailculator-mcp"**

The installation path may not be in your PATH. Find it with:
```bash
find / -name cailculator-mcp 2>/dev/null
```
Use the full path in your Claude Desktop configuration.

**Permission Denied**

If you get permission errors during installation:
```bash
pip3 install --user cailculator_mcp
```

Then update the command path in your config to point to `~/.local/bin/cailculator-mcp`.
