# CAILculator MCP Server

High-dimensional data analysis via Model Context Protocol.

Powered by proprietary Chavez Transform technology with proven mathematical foundations.

## Features

- **Advanced Pattern Detection**: Find hidden structures in high-dimensional data
- **Framework-Independent Analysis**: Works across different mathematical representations
- **Proven Reliability**: Built on verified mathematical theorems
- **Scales from 16D to 256D**: Handles complexity traditional methods can't

## Installation

```bash
pip install cailculator-mcp
```

## Setup

Add to your MCP client configuration (example for Claude Desktop):

**Mac/Linux:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
