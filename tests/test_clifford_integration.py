Targeted Verification Tests for CliffordElement Integration

These tests verify that the CliffordElement integration into the MCP server
produces correct results for key patterns identified in the confidence report.

Test Strategy:
- Pattern 18: Known to PASS with verified implementation (norm ≈ 0)
- Singleton Pattern: Known to PASS at 32D in Cl(5,0)
- Sample of 10 additional patterns from bridge_patterns_552.json
- Negative control: Pattern that should NOT be a zero divisor

Expected Results:
- All bridge patterns should verify correctly
- Implementation matches historical verification results
